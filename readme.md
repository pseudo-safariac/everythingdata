# Introduction to the Project
I chose a project from **Kaggle** and you can download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/logiccraftbyhimanshi/walmart-customer-purchase-behavior-dataset). This project is created as part of the coursework in [everythingdata][everythingdata-link] where I have to showcase my expertise in the data science course that I have been talking, which was a joint facilitation between [everythingdata][everythingdata-link] and [DataCamp][datacamp-link].


A big shoutout to both [everythingdata][everythingdata-link] and [DataCamp][datacamp-link] for helping me get the education and classes.

The dataset contains xxxxx. I chose to include the CSV dataset since I needed the project to be as air-gapped as possible and not require an internet connection after a `git pull`.

I first started with data exploration, as seen in the class called xxxxxxxxx, and found that xxxxxxxxxx.

After this, I discovered that xxxxxxxxx.

A big shoutout to both [everythingdata][everythingdata-link] and [DataCamp][datacamp-link]
